All of the content for this site is specified in markdown (`.md`) files, one for each section. The nav bar label and title of a section comes from the filename, the content comes from the file's contents. Sections can be reordered by adding their names to `order.txt` - any sections in this file will be pushed to the front in the order they appear.
